            <h2>What is Evaluation?</h2>
            <p>
                Evaluation is where you move beyond analysis and demonstrate critical thinking by assessing the impacts, assumptions, and priorities of a policy. Unlike analysis, which focuses on explaining the theory, evaluation challenges the theory and reflects on its limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to highlight uncertainties, priorities, and trade-offs. It’s not enough to state the expected outcomes of a policy—you must assess whether those outcomes are realistic, fair, and align with societal goals.

            <h2>The CLASPP Framework</h2>
            <p>CLASPP stands for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Summarize the theoretical insights from your analysis. What can we conclude from the theory and diagram?</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term and Short-term Effects:</strong> Explore whether the policy has different impacts over time. Are there unintended consequences?</li>
                <li><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Identify the assumptions behind the theory and analyze their limitations. Are they realistic?</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Discuss how the policy affects different groups such as consumers, producers, and the government.</li>
                <li><strong>Priorities:</strong> Reflect on the societal priorities that the policy addresses. Does it align with societal goals?</li>
                <li><strong>Pros and Cons:</strong> Highlight additional advantages and disadvantages of the policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Examples of Evaluation</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Long-term vs. Short-term Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    Short-term benefits of a policy might resolve immediate issues but create long-term inefficiencies. For instance, subsidies might encourage production in the short run but lead to overproduction in the long term, distorting markets.

                <h3>Assumptions</h3>
                <p>
                    Economic theories often assume "ceteris paribus" (all else remains constant). However, this is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. For example, a tax might assume rational consumer behavior, but in reality, consumers might not respond as expected.

            <article>
                <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
                <p>
                    A price ceiling might benefit consumers by lowering prices, but it could harm producers who can no longer sell at profitable rates. Identifying winners and losers is a key part of stakeholder evaluation.

            <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Avoid simply repeating the same points about the key concept. Add depth and new insights in each paragraph.</li>
                <li><strong>Overcomplication:</strong> Keep your analysis concise and focused. Use clear cause-and-effect relationships to explain economic outcomes.</li>
            </ul>
