            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to EconIAPro, a platform I created to help IB Economics students master their Internal Assessments and reach their highest potential. 
                My name is Luigi Sciascia, and I’m an HL Economics student with two years of dedicated study in the subject. My journey in economics began 
                not just with a curiosity about theory, but also with a desire to share knowledge and help my peers succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started tutoring fellow classmates early in my IB journey, focusing on breaking down complex economic concepts into simple ideas and 
                providing specific feedback on their IAs. It was one of the most satisfying moments of my academic career to see their grades progress 
                from 4s to 6s and even 7s. It made me realize just how much I enjoy teaching and the impact personalized guidance can have on others' success.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is unique about EconIAPro is the fact that I just love helping students. While I charge a little fee to cover my time and resources, 
                I’m not in it for the money. This platform is driven by my passion for economics and my view that quality guidance should be accessible to all. 
                My mission is to provide students struggling with the difficulties of IB Economics with quality, reasonably priced support.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my experience as a student, I have mastered some key IA components such as structure, evaluation, and diagrams in IA work. Beyond 
                the IB syllabus, I’ve also explored more advanced topics like Game Theory and Nash Equilibrium. I completed the NYU summer program in Economics 
                with an A grade, ranking higher than several undergraduate students.
