            <p>Above is the IA I submitted, which was awarded a perfect 7 by the IB examiners. Below, I've included my own thoughts on what I believe made it successful and areas that, with hindsight, could be further refined.</p>

            <h2>Reflections and Comments</h2>
            <h3>What I Did Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exceptional Integration of Theory and Context:</strong> My ability to connect theoretical concepts with the real-world context in the article was seamless. The discussion of aggregate demand and supply was supported with precise examples, demonstrating not only my understanding of the topic but also my ability to synthesize information effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear and Accurate Diagrams:</strong> The diagrams were well-drawn and annotated, making complex economic relationships easy to understand. I paid attention to detail to ensure that my visual aids enhanced the overall analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Evaluation:</strong> My evaluation addressed multiple perspectives, considering both short-term and long-term implications of the policy, as well as its effects on various stakeholders. This demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What I Could Have Done Better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploring Alternative Scenarios:</strong> While my analysis was robust, incorporating an additional alternative policy or comparing different government strategies could have enriched the commentary further. I often encourage my students to consider "what if" scenarios to elevate their evaluations.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth of Conclusion:</strong> Although my conclusion tied the commentary together well, a more explicit summary of how the policy aligns with societal priorities, such as equity or efficiency, could make it even stronger. This is a point I stress when advising students on their own IAs.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Real Data:</strong> Including more specific numerical examples or referencing additional real-world data from the article would have added depth to the analysis. This is a strategy I always recommend to my students to strengthen their arguments further.</li>
            </ul>
