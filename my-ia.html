                <h3>What I Did Well</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Incorporation of Theory into Context:</strong> I was able to connect the theoretical concepts with regard to the context of the article. Discussion of aggregate demand and supply had examples that were precise, showing not only my understanding of the topic but also my ability to synthesize information effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Diagrams:</strong> Diagrams were clear and annotated so that clarity would emerge, which helped in achieving ease of understanding of economic relationships. I ensured visual aids added, and do not take away from my overall analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Balanced Evaluation:</strong> Evaluation had multiple perspectives in consideration of the implication of policy in the short and long run, as well as the impacts of the different stakeholders; but also demonstrated knowledge of the dynamic nature of economics.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Things I Could Have Done Better</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Considering Alternative Scenarios:</strong> While the analysis was strong, adding one more alternative policy or comparing strategies from different governments might have enriched the commentary further. This is what I always say to my students: that you've got to have the "what if" scenario in order to take it to the next level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Depth of Conclusion:</strong> My conclusion tied the commentary together well, but a more comprehensive summary of how the policy matches up with societal priorities might make it stronger. This is a point that I stress when advising students on their own IAs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real Data Inclusion:</strong> More specific numerical examples or references to other real data from the article would have added depth to the analysis. This is a strategy I always recommend to my students in order to strengthen their arguments further and to score points with the IB examiner.</li>
                </ul>
