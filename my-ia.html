            <h1>My Macroeconomics IA</h1>
            <p>This is the Internal Assessment (IA) that I submitted for my IB Economics HL course, which scored a perfect 7. I've included my reflections on what I did well and areas where I could have made improvements to guide you in crafting your own outstanding IA.</p>

            <h2>Reflections and Comments</h2>
            <h3>What I Did Well</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Incorporation of Theory into Context:</strong> I was able to connect theoretical concepts with the context of the article. My discussion of aggregate demand and supply included precise examples, showing both my understanding of the topic and my ability to synthesize information effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Diagrams:</strong> My diagrams were clear and annotated, which helped to achieve clarity and made understanding economic relationships easier. Visual aids were well-integrated and enhanced my overall analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Evaluation:</strong> My evaluation considered multiple perspectives, addressing the implications of policy in both the short and long term, as well as the impacts on different stakeholders. I demonstrated knowledge of the dynamic nature of economics.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Things I Could Have Done Better</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Considering Alternative Scenarios:</strong> While my analysis was strong, including one more alternative policy or comparing strategies from different governments could have enriched the commentary further. This is something I emphasize with my students: having a "what if" scenario can take your IA to the next level.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth of Conclusion:</strong> My conclusion tied the commentary together well, but a more comprehensive summary of how the policy matches up with societal priorities could have made it stronger. This is a point I stress when advising students on their own IAs.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Data Inclusion:</strong> Adding more specific numerical examples or references to other real data from the article would have added depth to the analysis. This is a strategy I always recommend to my students to strengthen their arguments and impress IB examiners.</li>
            </ul>
