            <h2>Key Economic Concepts</h2>
            <p>Integrating key economic concepts into your IA is critical for scoring highly. These concepts act as a lens to analyze your article, giving depth and focus to your evaluation.</p>

            <h3>Why Key Concepts Matter</h3>
            <p>Key concepts are not just an add-on; they are central to your IA. They help you frame your analysis, connect economic theories, and demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Each of your three commentaries must use a different key concept, making it essential to align the concept with your chosen article effectively.</p>

            <h3>How to Choose the Right Key Concept</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Relevance to the Article:</b> Select a concept that aligns naturally with the issue in your article, such as "Intervention" for government policies or "Efficiency" for market failures.</li>
                <li><b>Clear Explanation:</b> Be prepared to define and explain the concept in the introduction, linking it consistently throughout your IA.</li>
                <li><b>Consistent Application:</b> Use the key concept as a lens in all parts of your analysis and evaluation, ensuring it remains central to your discussion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples of Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Equity:</b> Articles on income inequality or healthcare access.</li>
                <li><b>Sustainability:</b> Topics like environmental impacts of production or renewable energy policies.</li>
                <li><b>Efficiency:</b> Issues related to market failures or optimizing resource allocation.</li>
                <li><b>Interdependence:</b> Trade disputes or global economic shifts.</li>
                <li><b>Change:</b> Technological advancements or policy reforms.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps to Incorporate the Key Concept</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to ensure your key concept is seamlessly integrated into your IA:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Deconstruct the Concept:</b> Start your introduction by defining the key concept and explaining its significance. For example, if you choose "Intervention," explain why government action is needed and how it relates to your article.</li>
                <li><b>Link to the Article:</b> Highlight specific parts of the article that relate to the concept, ensuring a clear and logical connection.</li>
                <li><b>Develop in Analysis:</b> Use the concept to frame your analysis of the economic issue. For example, discuss how a tax policy impacts efficiency, equity, or other societal goals.</li>
                <li><b>Explore in Evaluation:</b> Discuss the pros and cons of the issue within the context of the concept. For instance, explain how "Intervention" could lead to unintended consequences while still achieving its primary goals.</li>
                <li><b>Conclude with Insights:</b> Summarize your findings, providing a nuanced understanding of the concept and its implications for the issue.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Repetition:</b> Avoid mentioning the key concept without developing it. Each mention should add value to your analysis.</li>
                <li><b>Lack of Focus:</b> Ensure your discussion remains centered on the chosen concept rather than drifting into unrelated topics.</li>
                <li><b>Wordiness:</b> Stay concise while providing depth. Tight, focused writing is key to staying within the IA word count.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Using key concepts effectively can elevate your IA from good to outstanding. By carefully selecting, integrating, and developing your concept, you can create a commentary that showcases both your analytical skills and your understanding of economics as a complex, multifaceted field.</p>
